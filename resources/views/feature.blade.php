                    Rambunctious is looking for new members to join the ranks of our club! We are very excited about what this year is going to bring and we can't wait to see some new faces.<br><br>

                    If you are interested in joining, come to G12 and/or R34 on Fridays for our weekly meetings. Some details about the club / more information is below. Please contact us if you have any questions!<br><br>

                    <ul>
                    <li>- There is no writing involved. Instead, do all of the design work related to composing a magazine.</li>
                    <li>- In joining the club, you'll learn skills that can take you anywhere. Adobe Indesign (the software we use) is such a powerful tool that can be used in many situations outside of print media.</li>
                    <li>- We generally meet on Fridays, and meet every day when we are deep in the process of putting the magazine together (although we don't expect you there every day). </li>
                    <li>- We encourage you to submit, even if you have decided that this club isn't for you! </li>
                    </ul>
